I am greatful for what the Lord has done in my life. The reality is that it was not easy but with God help I was able to achieve my academic goals in the higher institution.
It was indeed a great journey that taught me total dependence on God Almighty.

Also the friends God surrounded me with also help me to continue to work towards the goal being achieved.
